# Singularity

Singularity is a language constructed upon the following ideologies:
1. Minimum entropy: Try to convey as much information as possible with the least number of letters
2. Structured: Allow higher language-constructs to be formed by simple and scalable rules
3. Low ambiguity: Make the language software-parsable with minimal programming/AI effort
4. Flexible word order: This allows for a higher level of flexibility while writing poetry (which we seriously lack these days)
5. Keyboard friendly: No punctuation marks that are not available on US English Keyboard
6. Pleasant to hear: Not too many battle speeches or war-cries in Singularity :)
7. Gender agnostic: Verbs/Tenses/Suffixes do not change with gender

The language is under development.

# Terminology

1. Pronunciation: Will be enclosed in /.../
2. English words: Will be enclosed in single quotes '...' when explicity required
3. Singularity words: Will be enclosed in double-quotes "..." when needed to be explicitly called out

# Grammar

## Word Capitalization
1. A word with an uppercase first letter indicates a proper noun and no further grammatical rules apply on that word.
2. Sentences do not start on upper case.
3. Uppercase letter may be used in the middle of a word to indicate inflexions

## Word Order
While the primary word order, is Subject-Verb-Object, Singularity is designed to have complete flexibility with word order, where every combination conveys the exact same meaning.

|Order|Example|
|-|-|
|SVO|kati itas burgere|
|SOV|kati burgere itas|
|VSO|itas kati burgere|
|VOS|itas burgere kati|
|OSV|burgere kati itas|
|OVS|burgere itas kati|

All of the statements above mean "cat eats burger".
